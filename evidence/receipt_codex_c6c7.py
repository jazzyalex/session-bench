"""Regenerate the Codex C6/C7 receipt from a PINNED artifact list.

The artifact set is fixed by filename (recorded in the receipt), never
re-selected by mtime — re-running against the same files must reproduce the
same counts. The raw artifacts are private (they live in the local Codex
session store); the receipt therefore pins identity (full SHA-256) and the
exact query so the observation is auditable the moment the artifacts are
shared or spot-checked.

Usage:
